"""
Bubble sort is a intro sorting algorithm that compares pairs of elements connected during iteration. 

Swapping will occur to shit the elements to the begining or end of list. 

Two loops will be used to sort the list.   The first loop goes until the list is sorted or as long as the list is not sorted. 
The assumption will be made from the start that the list is unsorted. The inner loop will perform our checks greater than or less than
it will also make our swap. It is seen in many algorithms where you may have a swap function separated from the actual bubble sort
function we will implement.
